Continued strength in passenger demand and a record passenger load factor drove a 3.4% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter 2019 total revenue to a record $11.3 billion. Driven by a 2.4% increase in passenger load factor, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) grew 0.9% to 14.72 cents, a record for the fourth quarter. Cargo revenue was down 18.3% to $216 million due primarily to a 15.6% decline in cargo volume. Other revenue was up 5.4% to $750 million due primarily to higher loyalty revenue. Fourth-quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) increased by 0.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 on a 2.9% increase in total available seat miles.
Total fourth-quarter 2019 operating expenses were $10.6 billion, up 2.1% year over year, driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits, maintenance, and regional expenses. Total fourth-quarter 2019 cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 15.06 cents, down 0.8% from fourth-quarter 2018. Excluding fuel and net special items, consolidated fourth-quarter CASM was 11.59 cents, up 2% year over year.1
2020 Priorities             
In 2020, American is focused on operational excellence, efficient and profitable growth, and generating significant free cash flow.
	•	Operational excellence: Running a reliable operation is a significant driver of customers’ likelihood to recommend and American’s goal is to become customers’ airline of choice.
	•	Efficient and profitable growth: Grow in high-revenue markets that produce at or above average unit revenues, largely due to new gates in Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte, North Carolina.
	•	Generating significant free cash flow3: Use free cash flow to naturally de-lever the company’s balance sheet and return capital to American’s shareholders.
Operational Excellence
Over the past several months, American’s operational performance has shown significant improvement, including the company’s best-ever performance for both the holiday peak travel period and the entire fourth quarter of 2019. American achieved record results for combined mainline and regional on-time departures, on-time arrivals and completion factor.
“We are very pleased with the trajectory of our operation and are well on our way to delivering operational excellence,” said American Airlines President Robert Isom. “As we look ahead to 2020, we will continue to strengthen our operation and expect to see continued improvements in our reliability metrics.”
Efficient and Profitable Growth
American is committed to growing its network efficiently and profitably. In 2019, the company added 15 new gates at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. This growth resulted in a 21% increase in city pairs served and strong unit revenue. The company also added four new gates at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, with plans for three additional gates beginning in 2020. In addition, the company expects to upgauge 14 gates at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with dual-class regional jets when the new regional concourse opens in 2021.
Significant Free Cash Flow, Share Repurchases and Dividends
With American’s historic fleet renewal program winding down, the company’s level of capital investment is expected to decline. The company is committed to generating significant free cash flow for its shareholders in 2020 and beyond and presently expects to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow3 over the next two years. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, American returned $285 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 9.9 million shares of common stock and also paid $44 million in dividends. As of Dec. 31, 2019, the company had $565 million remaining of its existing $2 billion share repurchase authorization.4 In aggregate, American has returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders over the past five years through share repurchases and dividends, including $1.3 billion in 2019.
American declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid Feb. 19, 2020, to stockholders of record as of Feb. 5, 2020.
Fleet Update
On March 13, 2019, a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. American’s fleet currently includes 24 MAX aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order. As a result of this directive, American canceled approximately 10,000 flights in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The company has removed all MAX flying from its flight schedule through June 3, 2020, and will continue to asses this timeline.
Guidance and Investor Update
American expects its first-quarter 2020 pre-tax margin excluding net special items to be approximately flat year over year.5 Based on today’s guidance, the company expects its 2020 diluted earnings per share excluding net special items to be between $4.00 and $6.00.5
