Continued strength in passenger demand and record passenger yield drove a 3.1 percent year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter 2018 total revenue, to a record $10.9 billion. Driven by a 2.4 percent increase in passenger yield, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) grew 1.4 percent to 14.59 cents. Cargo revenue was up 3.0 percent to $264 million due to a 9.1 percent increase in yield. Other revenue was up 6.3 percent to $712 million due primarily to higher loyalty revenue. Fourth-quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) increased by 1.7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 on a 1.4 percent increase in total available seat miles.
Total fourth-quarter 2018 operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 4.2 percent year-over-year, driven by a 19.6 percent increase in consolidated fuel expense. Had fuel prices remained unchanged versus the fourth quarter of 2017, total fourth-quarter 2018 expenses would have been approximately $367 million lower. Total fourth-quarter 2018 cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 15.21 cents, up 2.7 percent from fourth quarter 2017. Excluding fuel and special items, consolidated fourth-quarter CASM was 11.32 cents, down 0.2 percent year-over-year.
Strategic Objectives
American’s long-term success is guided and measured by strategic objectives that ensure a healthy, competitive company for the long term: to create a world-class customer experience, make culture a competitive advantage, and build American Airlines to thrive forever by thinking forward and ensuring a strong financial foundation.
Create a World-Class Customer Experience
American has invested more than $25 billion in its team, product and fleet over the past five years – the largest investment of any carrier in commercial aviation history in such a short time. American continues to make large strides in delivering a world-class experience for its customers. In 2018, American:
	•	Activated free live TV, now on 270 aircraft. American continues to be the only U.S. carrier to offer live TV on international flights
	•	Expanded high-speed Wi-Fi, now on 570 aircraft, allowing customers to stream movies and TV shows. The rest of American’s long-term narrowbody aircraft will receive high-speed Wi-Fi in 2019
	•	Launched service on 86 new routes including 14 new destinations, such as Reykjavik, Iceland; Budapest, Hungary; and Prague, Czech Republic. In 2019, American will become the only U.S. carrier to travel nonstop to Bologna, Italy and Dubrovnik, Croatia
	•	Continued to deliver on its product segmentation strategy, expanding Basic Economy to Europe and adding Premium Economy to 103 aircraft. American offers Premium Economy on more aircraft than any other U.S. airline
	•	Ordered 47 new Boeing 787s to replace retiring aircraft and keep American’s fleet the youngest among U.S. network airlines
	•	Continued to offer a great premium experience on the ground and in the air, including renovating Admirals Club lounges in Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth. In 2019, American will open newly-renovated Admirals Club lounges in Boston, Charlotte and Pittsburgh, as well as a new, world-class premium Flagship Lounge and Flagship First Dining in Dallas-Fort Worth
Make Culture a Competitive Advantage
Taking care of team members translates into better customer care. American’s culture reflects its emphasis on providing the right tools, training and care for its frontline team members. In 2018, American:             
	•	Started the year by awarding team members $1,000 each as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
	•	Gave team members the opportunity to travel across American’s global network with two free round-trip tickets for the airline being named Air Transport World’s 2017 Airline of the Year
	•	Completed flight attendant operational integration, allowing flight attendants to fully intermix across the entire fleet. This integration creates improved scheduling options for flight attendants and the airline, and provides greater flexibility and service recovery during irregular operations
	•	Supported the victims of the deadly California wildfires, as American team members conducted one of the airline’s largest disaster relief efforts by assembling 20,000 American Red Cross hygiene kits at its Phoenix cargo facility
	•	Donated more than $35 million in cash and travel value across the globe in support of military and veteran’s initiatives, health research, disaster response and children’s well-being
	•	Awarded $11 million in cash and recognition points through programs that recognize team members for good work supporting customers and colleagues

	•	Broke ground on a $1.6 billion modernization project at Terminals 4 and 5 at Los Angeles International Airport, in partnership with Los Angeles World Airports
