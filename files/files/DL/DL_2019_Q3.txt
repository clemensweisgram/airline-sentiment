	•	Adjusted earnings per share were $2.32, a 29 percent increase year over year; Earnings per share and  adjusted earnings per share reflect 6.5 percent top-line growth, 2.5 points of operating margin expansion  and $1.4 billion of free cash flow.

	•	Consolidated operating cost per available seat mile ("CASM") decreased 2.1 percent compared to the  September 2018 quarter, primarily due to lower fuel costs and higher capacity.

December Quarter 2019 Outlook 
For the December quarter, Delta expects to deliver solid top-line growth and operating margin expansion. Year- over-year pre-tax margin is impacted by the one-time $91 million gain from the sale of the DAL Global Services business in the December 2018 quarter.

Revenue Environment 
Delta’s adjusted operating revenue of $12.6 billion for the September quarter improved 6.5 percent, $771 million higher than prior year quarter. This revenue result marks a quarterly record for the company, driven by improvements across Delta’s business, including a nine percent increase in premium product ticket revenue and strong percentage increases in loyalty and third-party maintenance revenue. Cargo revenue during the quarter declined 17 percent driven by lower volumes and yield. Other revenue increased by $30 million as growth in loyalty and third-party maintenance was offset by $102 million lower third-party refinery sales. Premium products and non- ticket sources now comprise 52 percent of Delta’s total revenue. 
Passenger Revenue by Geographic Region: 
	•	Domestic revenues grew 7.8% in the quarter on 3.2% higher passenger unit revenue (PRASM) and 4.5%  higher capacity. Domestic premium product revenue grew 11% and corporate revenue grew 8%, consistent  with growth in the first half of the year.  
	•	Atlantic revenues grew 3.2% in the quarter on 4.9% higher capacity and a 1.6% decline in PRASM, driven  almost entirely by foreign exchange rates. Premium cabin performance continues to outpace main cabin,  where non-U.S. point of sale demand has been impacted by uncertain economic outlook in the region.  
	•	Latin revenues grew 1.2% on a 3.6% increase in unit revenue and 2.3% lower capacity. This revenue  improvement was driven by continued double-digit unit revenue growth in Brazil and Mexican beach  markets offsetting demand pressure from Hurricane Dorian.  
	•	Pacific revenues declined 4.6% in the quarter on 3.3% higher capacity and a 7.6% decline in unit  revenues. Unit revenue performance was pressured by weaker macroeconomics, trade uncertainty and a nearly one point currency headwind.  “With our outstanding operations and unmatched service, more customers are choosing to fly Delta every day. Increased customer satisfaction is driving solid top-line performance -- September quarter revenues grew to a record $12.6 billion and we expect December quarter revenues to grow more than five percent versus prior year,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s president. “Strong demand and our customer-focused commercial initiatives are putting us on track to achieve a $3 billion increase in revenues this year, a pace of growth well in excess of GDP.”  Cost Performance  Total adjusted operating expense for the September quarter increased $345 million versus the prior year quarter, with 35% due to higher profit sharing expense. CASM-Ex was up 2.4 percent for the September quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This performance was driven by employee costs, record passenger volumes and the compounding effect of weather on the operation.  Adjusted fuel expense decreased $249 million, down ten percent relative to September quarter 2018. Delta’s adjusted fuel price per gallon for the September quarter was $1.96, which includes a $49 million benefit from the refinery.

Adjusted non-operating expense for the quarter was $65 million higher versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by pension headwind. 
“We are making important investments in our people and facilities to drive sustainable growth in our business. Unit cost performance in 2019 of approximately two percent is consistent with our long-term target ,” said Paul Jacobson, Delta’s chief financial officer. 
Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns 
Delta generated $2.2 billion of operating cash flow and $1.4 billion of free cash flow during the quarter after the investment of $814 million into the business primarily for aircraft purchases and improvements, and $150 million to support our strategic alliance with LATAM. Year to date, the company has generated $7.5 billion of operating cash flow and $4.0 billion of free cash flow. 
For the September quarter, Delta returned $468 million to shareholders, comprised of $208 million of share repurchases and $260 million in dividends. 
The Board of Directors has declared Delta's 26th consecutive quarterly dividend. The dividend of $0.4025 per share will be payable to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 24, 2019, to be paid on November 14, 2019. 
“With $7.5 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date, our strong cash generation sets Delta apart in the industry, and allows us to maintain consistent reinvestment in our business, an investment grade balance sheet and substantial cash returns to shareholders,” added Paul Jacobson, Delta’s chief financial officer. 
LATAM Airlines Strategic Partnership 
On September 26, 2019, Delta announced plans to enter into a strategic partnership with LATAM Airlines. Subject to customary conditions including regulatory approval, the company will invest $1.9 billion for up to 20 percent of the common shares of LATAM through a public tender offer at $16 per share, to be funded with newly issued debt and available cash. In addition, Delta will invest $350 million to support the establishment of the strategic partnership, $150 million of which was paid in the September quarter. Delta will also acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM, and has agreed to assume LATAM’s commitment to purchase 10 additional A350 aircraft. 
Delta expects that the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share over the next two years and that the transaction will not impact the company’s existing financial commitments to shareholders, including free cash flow and shareholder returns.

	•	Extended business traveler benefits for customers flying Virgin Atlantic and Aeromexico through Corporate Priority benefits, allowing better seat choice, priority boarding and priority service recovery, further removing seams in the travel experience.  Investment Grade Balance Sheet
