Revenue Environment 
Delta’s adjusted operating revenue of $10.4 billion for the March quarter improved 7.5 percent, or $728 million versus the prior year. This revenue result marks a March quarter record for the company, driven by improvements across Delta’s business, including an eight percent increase in premium product ticket revenue and double-digit percentage increases in loyalty and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul revenue. Cargo revenue declined five percent driven by lower volumes. 
“Demand for Delta’s product has never been stronger, as evidenced by our 7.5 percent top line growth in the March quarter. This underpins our expectation that June quarter unit revenue should grow 1.5 to 3.5 percent, with sequential improvement in passenger unit revenue across all entities,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s president. “With our customer-focused commercial initiatives delivering strong customer loyalty and top-line momentum, we now expect full-year revenue growth of five to seven percent, an increase from our prior guidance.” 
Cost Performance 
Total adjusted operating expense for the March quarter increased $510 million versus the prior year quarter. CASM-Ex was down 0.2 percent for the March quarter 2019 compared to the prior year period driven by record operations, a shift in expense timing and strong cost controls. 
Adjusted fuel expense increased $87 million, or five percent, relative to March quarter 2018. Delta’s adjusted fuel price per gallon for the March quarter was $2.05, which includes a $34 million loss at the refinery due to low gasoline crack spreads. 
Adjusted non-operating expense for the quarter was $69 million higher versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower pension income and earnings pressure from international equity partners. 
“Delta’s March quarter operating cash flow improved, driven by top-line growth, strong cost controls and margin expansion. Our cash flow performance allows us to reinvest for Delta’s long-term earnings growth, while maintaining our investment grade balance sheet and consistently returning cash to shareholders,” said Paul Jacobson, Delta’s chief financial officer. “With non-fuel unit cost momentum from our fleet transformation and One Delta efforts, we have clear line of sight to achieve our full year targets of one percent non-fuel unit cost growth and $3 to 4 billion in free cash flow.” 
Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns 
Delta generated $2 billion of operating cash flow, as improved profitability and the seasonal build of cash were partially offset by the $1.3 billion profit sharing payment to employees for 2018 performance. Delta generated $760 million of free cash flow during the quarter after the investment of $1.3 billion into the business primarily for aircraft purchases and improvements. 
Delta accelerated the repurchase of shares in the quarter, funded by a $1 billion short-term loan. During the quarter, the company repaid $300 million of this loan and expects that the remainder will be repaid by year end. Delta returned $1.6 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, comprised of $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $233 million in dividends.
